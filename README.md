Smart Time Management Application
This project is a Smart Time Management application built to help users track, manage, and analyze their daily activities. The application allows users to enter their time spent on various categories (like Work, Social Media, Games, etc.), save the data, and visualize it with interactive charts. Users can also manage their tasks, schedules, and reminders efficiently.

Features:
Time Tracking: Users can input the time spent on different activities and save it. The data is stored in the browser's localStorage.

Statistics: A pie chart is generated to visualize the distribution of time across categories.

Task Management: Users can add tasks to a to-do list, schedule tasks with a specified time, and set reminders for important activities.

Current Date & Time: The application displays the current date and time, updated in real-time.

Data Persistence: The data entered for categories, tasks, and reminders is saved in the browser's localStorage, making it persistent across page reloads.

Technologies Used:
HTML

CSS

JavaScript

Chart.js (for creating the pie chart)
